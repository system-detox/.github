## Hi there 👋

This is a collection of popular open source projects which have been detoxed from unnecessary and invasive cruft, including but not limited to, systemd, Rust, Electron etc. 


In case of appliance projects, typically these projects are based on top of Debian Linux - This is being replaced with Devuan Linux, a Debian distro where systemd hard requirements have been removed and you have a modular system with an init system of choice.
This not only increases stability and dependability, it also reduces overall maintenance, as it restores modularity and removes hard depdendencies.
In addition, where appliance OSes share code between Linux and BSD bases, we are also exploring the usage of the dinit init system and service supervision as it is compact, portable and does one thing very well.
